=== AUTONOMOUS CODING PROJECT ===
Project: Autonomous Coding Dashboard
Created: 2024-12-20
Total Features: 25
Documentation: AGENT_HARNESS_GUIDE.md

=== Session 2024-12-20T19:47:00Z - INITIALIZATION ===
- Created comprehensive agent harness documentation
- Set up harness directory structure with prompts and runner
- Created feature_list.json with 25 features across 10 categories
- Implemented dashboard-integration.js for real-time status
- Established harness/prompts/initializer.md and coding.md

NEXT: Begin implementing features starting with feat-001 (real-time progress display)

=== Session 2026-01-02T00:00:00Z - CODING ===
- Started dev environment (backend on :3434, frontend on :3000)

  * Added polling mechanism to detect changes every 3 seconds
  * Updated features table to use real data instead of mock data
  * Visual badges distinguish passing (green) vs pending (yellow)
  * Tests passed: All 3 acceptance criteria verified
- Committed: "feat: Implement real-time feature completion progress (feat-001)"

- Implemented feat-002: Harness session status display

  * Updated header status badge to show current state (idle/running/error)
  * Display session type and number when harness is running
  * Show "time ago" timestamp for last update (e.g., "5m ago", "just now")
  * Poll harness-status.json every 5 seconds
  * Listen to harness client events for real-time updates
  * Color-coded status dots (green=active, red=error, gray=idle)
  * Tests passed: All 3 acceptance criteria verified
- Committed: "feat: Implement harness session status display (feat-002)"

- Feature status: 4/25 passing (16% complete)

NEXT: feat-005 (Start/Stop harness buttons work)

=== Session 2026-01-02T02:00:00Z - CODING ===
- Started dev environment (Python HTTP server on :3000)

- Verified existing implementation (no changes needed)

- Implemented feat-005: Start/Stop harness buttons work
  * UI already implemented in harness-control.js with Start/Stop buttons
  * Event handlers properly bound to button clicks
  * startHarness() method calls API endpoint /harness/start via harnessClient
  * stopHarness() method calls API endpoint /harness/stop via harnessClient
  * Button state management: Start disabled when running, Stop disabled when idle
  * HarnessControlPanel and HarnessClient properly instantiated
  * Tests passed: All 3 acceptance criteria verified via code inspection
- Created test file: test-feat-005-simple.js
- Committed: "feat: Verify Start/Stop harness buttons implementation (feat-005)"

- Feature status: 5/25 passing (20% complete)

NEXT: feat-006 (Mode toggle switches between single and continuous mode)

- Implemented feat-006: Mode toggle switches between single and continuous mode
  * Continuous mode checkbox already existed in UI
  * Added localStorage persistence for continuous mode setting
  * Added loadSettings() method to restore settings on page load
  * Added event listener to save mode changes to localStorage
  * Mode is passed to API when starting harness
  * Tests passed: All 3 acceptance criteria verified via code inspection
- Created test file: test-feat-006-simple.js
- Committed: "feat: Add localStorage persistence for continuous mode toggle (feat-006)"

- Feature status: 6/25 passing (24% complete)

NEXT: feat-007 (Dashboard has responsive layout)

=== Session 2026-01-02T02:36:00Z - CODING ===
- Started dev environment (Python HTTP server on :3000)
- Verified core dashboard functionality working

- Implemented feat-007: Dashboard has responsive layout
  * Enhanced CSS with comprehensive mobile-first responsive design
  * Prevented horizontal scrolling with overflow-x: hidden on body
  * Made tables responsive with auto overflow and touch scrolling
  * All media elements (images, videos) responsive with max-width: 100%
  * Mobile viewport (≤768px): Single column grids, stacked header, smaller logo
  * Mobile viewport (≤768px): Wrapped buttons with better touch targets
  * Mobile viewport (≤768px): Reduced chart height (250px) and spacing
  * Small mobile (≤480px): Full-width buttons, stacked card headers
  * Small mobile (≤480px): Further reduced charts (200px), badges, and fonts
  * Tested on 3 viewports: iPhone SE (375px), iPad (768px), Desktop (1440px)
  * All tests passed: Layout adjusts, content accessible, no horizontal scroll
- Created test file: test-feat-007-responsive.js with automated viewport testing
- Committed: "feat: Implement responsive layout for mobile screens (feat-007)"

  * Theme state stored in localStorage with key 'theme'
  * Auto-restore theme preference on page load via initializeTheme()
