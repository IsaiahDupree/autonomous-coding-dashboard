## Summary
The video by Indy Dev Dan explores the future of agentic AI systems and how engineers can leverage these technologies to become top 2% engineers by 2026. It emphasizes the importance of building trust in AI agents, the rise of custom agents, and the shift towards multi-agent orchestration and agentic coding 2.0.

## Core Concepts & Ideas
- Agentic AI systems and workflows
- Trust as a central theme for 2026
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Custom agents for solving specific problems
- Tool calling as a measure of impact
- In-loop vs. out-loop agentic coding
- The decline of AGI hype in favor of practical agentic applications

## Key Software Practices
- Building custom agents to automate repetitive tasks
- Using tool calling to increase the impact of AI systems
- Developing private benchmarks for evaluating AI models
- Implementing multi-agent orchestration for complex tasks
- Utilizing agent sandboxes for safe experimentation

## Architecture & Design Patterns
- Multi-agent orchestration: Using a lead agent to manage sub-agents for task delegation and execution.
- Agent sandboxes: Isolated environments for running and testing agents safely.
- Out-loop agentic coding: Offloading tasks to agents without continuous human intervention.

## Tools & Technologies
- Gemini 3 Flash: A state-of-the-art AI model known for its speed and efficiency.
- Opus 4.5 and GBG 5.2: Other advanced AI models mentioned.
- Open Router: A platform for tracking AI model usage and performance.
- Claude Code: A tool for agentic coding and tool calling.
- Anthropic: A company providing AI models and tools for agentic systems.

## Actionable Takeaways
1. Develop custom agents to automate specific, repetitive tasks in your workflow.
2. Increase the use of tool calling in your AI systems to enhance their impact.
3. Experiment with multi-agent orchestration to handle complex, multi-step processes.
4. Create private benchmarks to evaluate AI models for your specific use cases.
5. Use agent sandboxes to safely test and iterate on agentic systems.
6. Shift focus from AGI hype to practical applications of agentic AI systems.
7. Implement out-loop agentic coding to free up time for more critical engineering tasks.

## Integration Opportunities for Our Stack
- **actp-worker**: Implement multi-agent orchestration to manage workflow execution more efficiently.
- **Safari Automation**: Use custom agents for enhanced browser control and market research.
- **ACTP Lite services**: Integrate tool calling to improve content generation and publishing processes.
- **CRMLite, WorkflowEngine**: Develop private benchmarks to evaluate AI models for CRM and workflow automation.
- **Dual-agent system**: Leverage both OpenAI and Claude for diverse agentic tasks.
- **Blotato publishing pipeline**: Use agentic systems to automate content creation and publishing.

## Quotable Moments
1. "Models are no longer the limitation - YOU and I are."
2. "Trust equals speed. Speed equals iteration and iteration equals impact."
3. "Custom agents solve custom problems. And custom problems make you a ton of money."

## Raw Transcript Excerpt

```
What's up engineers? Andy Dev Dan here. I [music] would place myself in the top 10% of engineers using agentic technology. Where would you place yourself? [music] Do you think you're top 15, top 10, top five? I want to become a top 2% [music] engineer and I want to take you along with me. In fact, I want you to surpass [music] what I can do. The best way to uplevel what you can do is to create a plan. [music] And that's exactly what I've done. Let me share with you my roadmap for becoming a top 2% agentic engineer in 2026. This is everything I'm thinking about. This is everything that I believe based on all the conversations, all the work I've done over the past years. This is what I think it looks like to become a top 2% a Gentic engineer in 2026. Let's first start with a couple big announcements that are going to tie in really well. So, first off, Gemini 3 Flash is absolutely insane. This model should not exist. Why do I say that? Why should this model not exist? It's because it is a top three intelligence model. Top five price. This hasn't happened before, by the way. You don't get intelligence and price. On top of that, what else do we have? We have the top speed. Some measurements are coming in at 200 tokens per second. It is a lightning fast model. Gemini 3 flash inputs text, images, audio, video, and PDF. And just real quick here, you can see this in the usage numbers, right? You have to ignore all the benchmarks, all these auxiliary numbers at some point and just look at the raw usage data. If we search for Gemini 3 flash preview, check this out on Open Router, 385% token increase usage. It's up in 13th place. I'm predicting this goes up to the top 10, potentially even the top five by the end of the year. So, it's a fantastic model. I've been using this thing alongside Opus 4.5. So, you know, what do these releases mean for engineers? Let's set up for 2026, right? What do these releases mean? What's coming next for us? All right, we have Gemini 3 Flash, Opus 4.5, and GBG 5.2. These are all stateofthe-art correct models. There has never been more opportunity for us engineers. We're going to break down that opportunity for 2026 right now in this video. These releases are telling us there are no winners. And this is a great thing, right? Competition drives innovation and it also drives price down. That means intelligence per token is going up. And that means you and I, the engineer, we can do more. Take a look at these prices. Gemini 2.5 flash 30 cents. Gemini 3 flash 50 cents. A lot of engineers see a price increase here. I see a price decrease. Why is that? It's because Gemini 3 Flash is competing with top state-of-the-art models. Okay, intelligence per token has gone up. That means cost per intelligence or cost per token has gone down. You get more for less. That's a big theme. Keep that in mind as we work through this. All right, the model ecosystem is competitive. So, this is great. Like I mentioned, this gives us optionality. Out of al...
