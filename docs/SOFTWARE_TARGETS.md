### 22. SnapMix

> **"Stay in tempo with your people." — The social layer for DJs and producers.**

SnapMix is a Snapchat-style track sharing platform built for the music production community. Send a beat, stem, or set clip as an ephemeral "Snap" and watch in real time as the recipient opens it, plays it, loops specific bars, and drops timecoded reactions. It's the fastest, most visceral way for producers and DJs to share, react, and collaborate.

**What it does:**
- **Track Snaps** — Share audio as ephemeral, access-controlled snaps with expiration and play limits
- **Real-Time Visual Player** — Immersive landing page with waveform visualization, spectrum analysis, and generative visuals
- **Live Presence** — See when someone opens your track, what section they're listening to, how many times they've replayed
- **Timecoded Reactions** — Drop fire emojis, markers, and comments at specific timestamps in the track
- **Snap Replies** — Record and send back a 15–30 second audio response with commentary
- **Security First** — No raw file delivery, signed JWT playback tokens, segmented streaming, forensic watermarking (post-MVP), and encryption at rest
- **DJ Networking** — B2B matchmaking, set sharing, and collaboration spaces (post-MVP)
- **Live Listen Rooms** — Synchronized group listening sessions with real-time chat (post-MVP)

**The dopamine loop for senders:**
> "Opened" → "Playing" → "Looping bar 9–16" → "Left a 🔥 at 0:45" → "Replayed 3x"

**Who it's for:** Music producers sharing beats and WIPs, DJs sharing set clips and transition notes, vocalists receiving and reacting to beats, and mix engineers collaborating on tracks.

| Complexity | Primary Model | Fallback |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | `claude-opus-4-6` | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` |
| High | `claude-opus-4-6` | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` |
| Medium | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Low | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Trivial | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
