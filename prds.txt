"How can we make it as easy as possible for users to go to a project, click on it, see the current status from the previous PRD, resume status, let it, give it a monitor and have access to the terminals via the agents and then if needed throw in another PRD that gets synced with the existing PRD and or changes, you know, via text or voice input and then from there.It registers those changes in the PRD and then makes comprehensive tests for those changes to then be able to re-delegate out and strategize and plan out the work to meet those tests for the autonomous coding agent."

I wanted to make a note to say, what are the full list of web app projects and mobile app projects that I have currently, make a list of those, create app icons for those, and then segment them out, classify them based on which ones have high touch, high profitability, and high difficulty, and other nice, unique metrics to classify projects, coding projects. And then, delegate out the ones that have the low touch, high profitability, and low difficulty, and then kick those off to an automated solution. And then for the ones that have the high touch, high profitability, high difficulty, leave those for the human tasks. And I want to make a full list of that. And then for building out the automated solution, I wanted to create a dashboard display to indicate status, instead of a CLI, but it still uses the CLI in other programs, to indicate what part of the progress process the automated solution is on, in terms of working on projects. And then, yeah, make a full list of that, and then create a basic webpage I could update to see all the different projects, and their app icons, and the statuses of each of them. And, like, have, like, have, like, this application start on startup, so I could be reminded, and not forget about the project status, if my computer restarts, or if Terminal 2, or Terminal 3, or Terminal 4, or Terminal 5, or Terminal 6, or Terminal 7, or Terminal 8, or Terminal 9, or Terminal 10. Terminals close, stuff like that.

Delegate to Automation (Low/Mid Touch, High Profit, Lower Difficulty)
These are the ones that match your “low touch, high profitability, low/medium difficulty → automated solution” rule:
SteadyLetters (operationally very automatable)
Engineering Calculators infrastructure (calculator hosting, not niche logic)
Prompt Sharing & Storage App
AI Context Organizer
Transcript & Social Description App
SassHot
部分 of YTQuizzes (transcription + quiz generation engine)
部分 of PulseLense (data ingestion, scoring, alerting)
Think of these as bots running money machines in the background.
High-Touch, High-Profit, High-Difficulty (Your Human Zone)
EverReach
BlogCanvas
Automation & Workflow Platform
MatrixLoop.app
High-level PulseLense UX / strategy
Local Newsletter SaaS (if you pursue it seriously)
Transparent (because of complex product & behavior design)
These need your brain: product strategy, UX, branding, positioning, sales.
3. Icon Concepts for Each App
These are visual briefs you or a designer (or a future image model) can turn into real icons.

4. Automation Dashboard + Webpage + Startup
4.1. Data Model for Projects
Use a simple JSON as your “single source of truth”:
[
  {
    "id": "everreach",
    "name": "EverReach",
    "type": "web+mobile",
    "category": "crm",
    "touch_level": "high",
    "profit_potential": "high",
    "difficulty": "high",
    "automation_mode": "human-core",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "last_update": "2025-12-05T15:00:00Z",
    "next_action": "Ship iOS build with entitlement fix",
    "icon": "icons/everreach.png"
  },
  {
    "id": "sasshot",
    "name": "SassHot",
    "type": "web",
    "touch_level": "low",
    "profit_potential": "high",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "automation_mode": "auto-core",
    "status": "idle",
    "last_update": null,
    "next_action": "Create initial keyword ingestion script",
    "icon": "icons/sasshot.png"
  }
]

Your CLI automation runners can update this JSON or a tiny SQLite DB as they work.
4.2. Basic Dashboard Webpage (Static + Fetch)
A very simple starting point (you can wire this into any stack later):
index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Isaiah Project Radar</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; margin: 24px; }
    .grid { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 16px; }
    .card { border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 12px; padding: 16px; width: 260px; }
    .card-header { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; }
    .icon { width: 32px; height: 32px; border-radius: 8px; background: #eee; }
    .pill { display: inline-block; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 999px; font-size: 11px; margin-right: 4px; }
    .pill-high { background: #fee2e2; }
    .pill-auto { background: #e0f2fe; }
    .status { font-weight: 600; margin-top: 8px; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Project Radar</h1>
  <div id="grid" class="grid"></div>

  <script>
    async function loadProjects() {
      const res = await fetch('projects.json?_=' + Date.now());
      const projects = await res.json();
      const grid = document.getElementById('grid');
      grid.innerHTML = '';

      projects.forEach(p => {
        const card = document.createElement('div');
        card.className = 'card';

        card.innerHTML = 
          <div class="card-header">
            <div class="icon" style="background-image:url('${p.icon}'); background-size:cover;"></div>
            <div>
              <div><strong>${p.name}</strong></div>
              <div style="font-size:12px;color:#666;">${p.type}</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <span class="pill pill-high">Touch: ${p.touch_level}</span>
            <span class="pill pill-high">Profit: ${p.profit_potential}</span>
            <span class="pill pill-auto">Mode: ${p.automation_mode}</span>
          </div>
          <div class="status">Status: ${p.status}</div>
          <div style="font-size:12px;margin-top:4px;">Next: ${p.next_action || '—'}</div>
        ;

        grid.appendChild(card);
      });
    }

    loadProjects();
    setInterval(loadProjects, 15000); // refresh every 15s
  </script>
</body>
</html>

Drop that in a folder with projects.json and icons/.
Open index.html in a browser or serve via a tiny python -m http.server.
4.3. Connecting CLI Automations to the Dashboard
Pattern:
Your automation script (Node/Python) runs a pipeline for a given project.
At each key stage (e.g., ingesting_data, running_tests, deploying), it:
Updates projects.json for that project’s status and next_action.
Optionally writes a log file per project.
Pseudo-Node (conceptual):
// updateStatus.js
import fs from 'fs';

export function updateProjectStatus(id, patch) {
  const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('projects.json', 'utf8'));
  const idx = data.findIndex(p => p.id === id);
  if (idx === -1) return;
  data[idx] = { ...data[idx], ...patch, last_update: new Date().toISOString() };
  fs.writeFileSync('projects.json', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
}

Your scripts call:
updateProjectStatus('sasshot', { status: 'running', next_action: 'Fetching TikTok keyword data' });
// run CLI / API work...
updateProjectStatus('sasshot', { status: 'idle', next_action: 'Review results & design UI' });

Now the dashboard auto-refresh shows where each automation is in the flow.
4.4. Launching at Startup (Mac)
Goal: when your Mac reboots, your “Project Radar” is always visible.
Two easy patterns:
Option A – Just open the dashboard page
Put index.html somewhere stable (e.g. ~/ProjectRadar/index.html).
In System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items, add:
Your browser, with that file as “Open at Login” (or)
An Automator app that runs:
open ~/ProjectRadar/index.html
Option B – Start a local server + open it
If you prefer http://localhost:4000:
Create a tiny Node or Python server in ~/ProjectRadar/.
Make a shell script start-radar.sh:
#!/bin/zsh
cd ~/ProjectRadar
npm run dev &    # or python -m http.server 4000 & 
sleep 5
open "http://localhost:4000"

Mark it executable: chmod +x start-radar.sh
Add this script to Login Items (via Automator “Run Shell Script” or directly).
Now, even if Terminal windows die, the server restarts on next login, and the dashboard opens itself, so your brain is always reminded of:
What projects exist
Which ones are automated money machines
What’s currently running / blocked / idle
If you want, next step I can:
Turn this into a more concrete JSON for all 19 projects filled out, or
Help you define the exact status stages your automations will use (e.g., scheduled → running → waiting-for-input → failed → done).
